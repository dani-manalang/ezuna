This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


## To access via https
If you want to test connect to metamask in mobile, this is only possible using walletconnect and accessing localhost via https. See this [step-by-step guide](https://medium.com/@greg.farrow1/nextjs-https-for-a-local-dev-server-98bb441eabd7) to setup https access locally.

```bash
npm run start-https
# or
yarn start-https
```
